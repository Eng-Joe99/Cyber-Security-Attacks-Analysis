# Cybersecurity Attacks Analysis and Dashboard  

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on global cybersecurity incidents. The project aims to uncover patterns and insights using data cleaning, exploration, and visualization techniques. The final deliverable includes a dashboard created in Power BI to effectively communicate the findings.

## Project Overview  
The primary objective of this project is to analyze cybersecurity attack data, identify trends, and provide actionable insights. The analysis includes:  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Visualization of key metrics and trends  

The final Power BI dashboard showcases insights emphasizing user-friendly and impactful design.

## Tools and Technologies  
- **Python**: Used for data cleaning and exploration  
- **Power BI**: Used for creating the final dashboard  
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Libraries for data manipulation and computation
- **Microsoft SQL Server**: Used for data validation

## Key Insights  
Some of the insights drawn from the analysis include:  
- The total number of attacks by country can help identify how different regions or cities within the same country compare in terms of attack frequency. A particular city might have vulnerabilities in its cybersecurity infrastructure or might be a frequent target due to political, economic, or technological factors.
 
- User information associated with each attack may reveal patterns such as the types of users or businesses targeted in different cities. For instance, cities with more corporate or government infrastructure might show a higher volume of sophisticated attacks aimed at large organizations.

  
- A correlation between high anomaly scores and malware detection can suggest a strong relationship between the severity of network activity anomalies and the presence of malicious software.

-Analyzing which protocols (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP) are most frequently used in attacks can reveal common methods attackers use to penetrate networks. For example, a high prevalence of TCP-based attacks may indicate that attackers exploit specific vulnerabilities in TCP connections.
